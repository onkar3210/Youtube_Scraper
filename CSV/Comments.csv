Detalhes
Bro serious how did you talk about the Heat Knicks matchup THAT longüò≠
the nets are not a young team
nigga u couldn‚Äôt just wait for the kings warriors game to be done ?
See u would have bet against the heat every time but the heat won me $4k
"Embiid career story is just being 2nd all the time man, 2nd best center, 2nd best in the division, 2nd round out"
"Well butler is out, so easy road for celtics"
Jimmy may miss a game but he&#39;s not going to miss the next few games
"the hawks overperformed, leave it at that"
Jimmy in 5
Imagine have the stat line of 17 6 and 9 and people say you‚Äôre a bit of a disappointment. Man prime James Harden was special‚Ä¶
You are the GOAT of NBA Content bro
Coach bud sold on purpose
To be honest with you I want see laker vs heat rematch in 2020 bubble
"I respect that and I agree that Boston has a mental edge on us bc we struggle big time against Boston, I‚Äôm just hopeful that our guys will push past it and dominate, but we will see. 1st game tonight and I can‚Äôt wait. Hopefully Embiid is healthy and ready to go, and that they just have him doubtful to throw Boston off. üôè"
Nothing unexpected in the playoffs
Garland and Sexton were better offensively than Garland and Mitchell.
No mention of Darius Garland when talking about Knicks v cavs
I don‚Äôt even want to hear about Giannis‚Äôs injury being used as an excuse. It‚Äôs not valid whatsoever
RNG is why I love sports ... Nothing is ever guaranteedüòÇ
RNG is why I love sports ... Nothing is ever guaranteedüòÇ
I think the craziness of that Butler alley oop layup to send the game into overtime flew right over my head after watching his 56 point game.<br><br>Absolutely insane to make that shot with .5 seconds left.
"Ok this is similar to players choosing to play w injuries. Since they had to option to sit out and get better but chose to play instead, we gotta judge them on their play w an allowance for a dip in performance given their injury<br><br>But we‚Äôll call it as we see it. Harden had a hamstring injury during the ‚Äò21 ECSFs and he played like trash. <br><br><br>So condolences to Bud and his family. However, since he chose to coach instead of taking time away when he had a very valid reason, we gotta judge on how he performed and he failed dismally"
Don&#39;t sleep on the Celtics
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYmbpV8di4&amp;t=2m08s"">2:08</a> what the Robinson"
"Imagine if we have that Bubble championship, Between the Lakers and Miami in the Finals."
"Watching this after the first game between the nicks and heat, and I have to say things aren&#39;t looking good for the heat."
"@Alex Sheldon Jimmy was hobbling, proly rolled his ankle, I really want the heat to win, but it ain&#39;t lookin likely"
"We won the game, fym?"
"Tyler is not a rotational player, he‚Äôs our second leading scorer !!!!"
I‚Äôll disagree with the bam thing. Robinson has 1 problem. He‚Äôs not that good outside the paint. Bam doesn‚Äôt have a lot in his bag on offense but for a big he can handle the ball and has proven you can‚Äôt leave him open for a jumper. Which pulls Robinson out. And with love in and we know love can catch fire at any time from 3 the paint is almost wide open.
"So again garland gets a passüòÇ, no mention of him is CRAZY dom, dude was baddd"
First time ever the 2nd round has a <br>1st seed- Denver <br>2nd seed- Boston <br>3rd seed- Philadelphia <br>4th Seed- Phoenix <br>5th Seed- New York <br>6th Seed- Golden State <br>7th Seed- Los Angeles <br>8th Seed- Miami
This really soothes my OCD soul
Josh Hart for free? He cost a first round pick
"mitchell robinson, looney, jokic, bam, time lord, the lack of steven adams...they say the big man is dead in this league. aint no way."
Keep it up Dom.  You rock
Spo is a better coach than Tibs.  Fuck the Knicks.
Too many injuries in the east
Lmao yes the knicks acquisition of Josh Hart for literally free should be investigated
"Mitchell ain‚Äôt in sync with his new team. Usually it be him all year for the Cavs but when you in a series, teams gone figure ya game n force you to trust ya teammates but Cavs so stuck on Mitchell do everything bigs save everything n it didn‚Äôt do well. Yes Brunson is in the same boat but Brunson didn‚Äôt come over as a star. So game plan Evolved around the team and him not like Mitchell n the team."
I don‚Äôt know what the hell you were thinking but I had the Knicks moving on to the 2nd round no surprise to me. I have the Knicks in 7.
I‚Äôm from south Florida so I had Miami &amp; Knicks lol‚Ä¶ also I‚Äôm moving to Orlando to get my masters so if I see u in the streets I‚Äôm a talk trash on how we whooping the Celtics if y‚Äôall make it passed Philly
I like how u don‚Äôt mention when Boston beat Sixers they were healthy and won by 3. Still was close
Lakers suck.<br>Warriors in 5.
This might be the most craziest first round we‚Äôve ever had. I don‚Äôt know how many times three lower seeds be a 3 top seeded teams.
Damn So forget Ma 6ers Huh? Lol
Your lucky embiid is out
Lakers/Suns Conference Finals | Celtics/Heat Conference Finals
"Jimmy Butler this playoffs so far has been nuts. As far as the Celtics and 76ers go, with Embiid out you have removed the X factor for this series. Without Embiid I don‚Äôt see the 76ers doing well in this series. James Harden can‚Äôt do everything. On the Boston side of things Tatum and Brown are going to do what they do. Should be a highly competitive series."
It‚Äôs def bouta be Celtics heat
The Heat are legit the only 8th seed I think might have a chance to win the championship
@Ayy Shaddy I‚Äôll come back to this when the Celtics make the ecf
@leen no.
@Ferchango Celtics is winning
@Ferchango lakers for sure can there is no team left in the postseason expect maybe Boston that has the defense to<br>Shut out the paint no defenders for Lebron and many defensive options Vanderbilt Dennis ad
@Rat Man I mean yes they still not a healthy team but if they were a healthy team they will not end up in 8th seed
Put 19-20 harden on the sixers and they‚Äôre EASILY running through the East
Even if the shooting percentage goes down it‚Äôs not going to be 20 percent like the Knicks Miami is literally dare New York garbage self to shoot and take Brunson away from the paint and Miami had a whole season last season as a top shooting team and it has the same players so why do y‚Äôall say back to earth as if they weren‚Äôt a good shooting team all last season why can‚Äôt this be them being coming back to earth and playing how they supposed to like y‚Äôall been seeing in 6 games straight but y‚Äôall waiting for them to come back to earth so whatever that shit mean
Why even post this knowing we have a game 7 today
Giannis missed 2 games and they won one so the fans need to stop. Herro missed more games and is the second best offensive player on the heat team so I‚Äôm not giving anyone the Giannis excuse
LeBron vs Jimmy pt. 2 is gonna end world hunger.
Nuggets are going to win the championship.
New York is not beating <b>HIM</b>
I got Heat in 5 or 6 tops. I got 76ers in 7. I got Lakers in 6 over Warriors. I got Nuggets in 7 over Suns
Did you just call Tyler Herro a rotational player? A 20pt a game starter? GTFO!!!! Clown!
Lesss goo
If the Celtics fall short &amp; jaylen brown don‚Äôt make all nba (which I think he will ) I could honestly see him wanting out &amp; obviously Atlanta would be the favorites.. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happening at all but it would be fun
Yep at this point the brown tatum duo has to blown up by the celtics if they dont make it out the east  this year theres no excuses and i actually enjoy seeing them play but they have been together and failed together alot as long as theyre healthy if they lose this time healthy this celtics team is done ü§¶üèæü§¶üèæ
"If the nba playoffs were treated like a March madness brackets, EVERYONE‚ÄôS brackets would be busted after the first round."
Philly in 7
"It&#39;s only unexpected because you don&#39;t actually pay attention to basketball and how it&#39;s played. You just care about drama, narratives, stories and other bullshit. If you knew how teams operate, then you&#39;d know how Miami, Lakers and the Knicks won their matchups."
Heat aren‚Äôt beating Knicks
"Im gonna make almost a quarter milion dollars if its nugs v heat in the finals. Just saying... Please nugs and heat, make my life better."
Lmao Celtic Lakers
"Lakers vs Dubs is the finals in my opinion. Nuggets might have something to say about that, but every other team is just too flawed"
@Rocky Salvatore but not always in the semis
West is always the real finals
Miami shot poorly and still won game 1.<br><br>New York better hit them 3s or Miami can just zone all day and stifle NY‚Äôs interior scoring
"Ive been telling everyone its the year of the old man. All the over thirties are blowing up into amazing performances. <br><br>Russ, Butler, Lebron, Steph, Lowery, Dray its crazy and i cant wait for the inevitable CP3, Harden, kevin love game. <br><br>Its an old man renaissance lol.<br><br>Dont get me wrong im loving it but im wondering if theres something in the water or a cheap new epo lol."
Kevin love actually had that game in game 5 but it was cut short because the refs gave him multiple late fouls that saw him fouled out.
"Calling it now, Kevin Love is gonna do nothing for almost the entire series then randomly blow up for 20 points in a quarter and win a game"
Udonis Haslem Finals MVP confirmed
"Dementia. They all think they&#39;re still in their prime. Lebrun even told Austin calm down UNC, after he said I&#39;m him."
Could be the last time we ever see Lebron vs Curry in a playoff match-up so dont take these games for granted
I didn‚Äôt know coach Buds brother died during this series. And seeing all the hate towards him as if he‚Äôs the only one to blame is kinda sickening now. Hope he‚Äôs doin alright
"yeah but at the same time, he gets paid to bring success to the team, and he fucked up"
This is awful. I‚Äôm not a guy to bash coaches or players when I don‚Äôt know enough context but I will tell you that I for sure thought Bud would be fired after this series. I really hope the best for him and if he is fired from the bucks he‚Äôll get a new job quickly. He‚Äôs a good coach
"@JULIUS BIGHORO exactly what I was going to say. I was flaming him well before I found out and now feel terrible. However, he will probably still be fired regardless because he is a repeat offender of the same bullshit he pulled this series. But I hope he is doing okay right now."
Probably explains why he wasn‚Äôt coaching well.
"You can understand that affecting him in game 3-4, but he has been making shit coaching decisions long before that happened."
"My thoughts:<br>Heat vs Bucks: Disappointed in the Bucks&#39; coach<br>Knicks vs Cavs: Basically a repeat of Hawks vs Knicks in 2021<br>76ers vs Nets: Credit to Brooklyn for fighting, but never had a chance<br>Hawks vs Celtics: credit to Atlanta and Celtics got to fix some things cause if they were nearly taken to 7 by the most mid team of all time, they&#39;ll struggle against the 76ers. Also, if Boston loses game 1 and/or 2 without Embiid, they&#39;re in trouble for the rest of the series"
Lol what happened to duncan?? Thought he was going to be the next good shooter.....
We got the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 seed all playing 2nd round that&#39;s crazy
This is a historic postseason
Miami gonna beat da Knicks ass
Don what happened to the podcast?
"Not trying to hate Dom, you&#39;re my guy... it&#39;s just a little FUStrating hearing you forget the first R in frustrating every time ;)"
He&#39;s black bruh lol. They can&#39;t help the illiteracy dude. Don&#39;t axe him to change
"As a Lakers&#39; fan im worried. AD has a golden opportunity to truly define his legacy. LeBron is likely biting nails because the GOAT narrative could be officially be put to bed if Curry &amp; the Warriors win this series.<br><br>Honestly, this year&#39;s playoffs have been pretty fantastic. Much better than previous years and I think the return of parity last year helps."
"@BuzzinFromda4z but this isn&#39;t about lebron how he was back in 2018, rn he&#39;s showed some of a Step back, he gets gassed now."
‚Äã@BuzzinFromda4z Sadly Lebron gets Curry without KD around him just by the time he&#39;s old and in his last years.
@BuzzinFromda4z hope it becomes true man lebron needs to sweep someone and I hate fricking bandwagons mostly in the Bay area
"Lebron not worried , the gs don‚Äôt have Kevin Durant anymore . They only have 2 rings in 2017&amp;2018 because kd was there . All Lebron haters want lakers to lose because Lebron James beating the 2nd seed then beating gs (champs) in the 2nd round will enhance his goat legacy . Lebron is healthy , he got rest , hasn‚Äôt played since Friday , I think lakers sweep gs , Lebron didn‚Äôt forget 2017&amp;2018 when he got the broom"
"Lebron James abojt to lead the 7th seed to the chip üò≠ mj never did that . Curry Vs Lebron James part 6, series between them are 2-3. Lebron about to tie it ."
@gregory munits you&#39;re arguing with an npc brotha lol. Just enjoy bball breakdown vid and let this black Twitter queen be
@BuzzinFromda4z Anthony Davis is carrying us. Shut up brontard
@BuzzinFromda4z AD literally carried them this series. LeBrick can‚Äôt even hit a three while attempting 8 of them a game
"@gregory munits yes he is . He just avg the most points round 1 vs grizzlies , and he had the 20&amp;202 game , hit the clutch shot which saved them from being down 2-3 because they lost game 5. Stop hating"
Lebron not even the best player on the lakers üíÄ
I thought it was blood bath when we played against the kings now we got bron this going to be even more exciting if embiid is not healthy yall could win in 5 we&#39;ll see what happens
"I got Celtics in 6 against Philly too, but mainly it&#39;s because I&#39;ve lost all trust in Doc Rivers. But yeah, I hope Joel Embiid gets better soon, I always hate seeing him get hurt."
"@Samuel lmaooo facts cuz he really tweaking if he think those series will end in sweeps, none of the 2nd round series this year will end that way if it does i would be terribly surprised but if they dont his comment wont age well and those teams are too stacked to fail too easily so he def smoking some outta this universe shit to think they will have sweeps this 2nd round ü§¶üèæü§¶üèæüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ none of those teams are the nets üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£"
"@Jose Garcia for real all those series could go 7, I need what he‚Äôs smokin"
‚Äã@Samuel yea he def dont know nba if hes being that bold we all know those two series are not gonna end in any sweeps itll be the exact opposite those series can go to 7 full games ü§¶üèæüòÇü§£üòÇü§£ü§£üòÇ
@BuzzinFromda4z 76ers in 6 is crazy
@Samuel nigga Knicks is shit and warriors got no defense
I said this before and I will again... this season was a failure for Giannis and the bucks... PERIODD
Wat duz it mean fuhr it to be ah felure huh? You have eh job yes.... You support yuwer femily yes ü§£üò≠
As a heat fan im still astonished miami is up 1 to 0 in the 2nd round as an 8 seed..
"@Jacob Sizemore¬† it depends bro but ecf might be heat vs. Celtics rematch, which is insane to have..."
"I mean if we can beat the 1 seed, we can beat anyone"
@bptboy exactly ad outdpoyd the dpoy
@BuzzinFromda4z I mean I‚Äôd take any of the top 3 seeds out East over anyone in the West.
@BuzzinFromda4z The LAKERS not just Lebron lol
heat v Celtics happens at some point in the playoffs like every year lol
@Sul Whale Lakers  No chance tbh
@Intelligent Man warriors or lakers winning tbh
"@Prodigy Gamer Sixers with Embiid can beat the Celtics off the sheet fact they have no bodies to throw at him, all his teammates have to do is knockdown open shots. If he misses more than 1 game though it‚Äôs over for the Sixers."
‚Äã@BuzzinFromda4z Celtics Winning Chip Sixers and Heat are no match
"@Prodigy Gamer I think he going to play , it he don‚Äôt then Celtics have to beat them 3 more times"
A James Harden revival series would be crazy.
Not happening especially since all the Celtics guards are good defenders besides pp
@Devean Buchanan look at westbrook&#39;s physique<br><br>then look at harden&#39;s<br><br>then get back to me
"‚Äã@Devean BuchananWestbrook is still a beast, his issue was/is decision making. Harden has good decision making but his skills are on the decline. I think it&#39;s still possible for Harden to have a monster game or two but it&#39;s less likely. Especially playing with Embiid"
@Matt Passos harden has ALWAYS been better than westbrook in the playoffs apart from when they were in OKC. Are you really comparing 1st round exits to ECF runs against the KD warriors????
"@Devean Buchanan difference is westbrook used to be good in the playoffs harden has always had problems and has always gotten shit for it, if he didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúrevival‚Äù then why have one now?"
And people say the East is more competitive than the West. The West has always been better overall than the East Since Kobe and Shaq era. That a F-ing long time.
Yeah crazy how Kobe has such a good track record in that conference lol
Playoffs is about MATCHUPS.<br>NOT regular season record/stats.
&quot;Josh Hart is there to do dirty work&quot; Aged well unfortunately
What was that idiotic placement by Josh Hart that injured Jimmy Butler.
ECF: Boston v NYK<br>WCF: GSW v PHX
‚Äã@BuzzinFromda4z knicks played probably their worst playoff game and only lost by 7 they will readjust and win
this i would love to see Knicks vs celtics rival match up would be insane
"Boston isn‚Äôt beating the 76ers , knicks isn‚Äôt beating the heat , Gs is not beating lakers ,"
warriors vs lakers is about to be a incredible series we are getting bron vs steph for possibly the last time
You didn&#39;t expect and you love to see that
"For the 6th at that . Curry is 3-2 over Lebron James in the playoffs or finals . Curry won 2015,2017,2018 Lebron won 2016&amp;2021 play in ."
Denver over Boston!!
"Nuggets isn‚Äôt making the finals , Lebron is healthy this season."
Miami has been stroking it really well in the playoffs
‚Äã@Rocky Salvatore ayo
Heat fans have too
ùêèùêÄùêîùêíùêÑ
when are you not horny
Hell yeah really making the court wet all over
lakers in 6
Draymond was telling Poole: ‚Äú you better get your shi together or else I‚Äôll knock you out again ‚Äú üòÇ <br><br>AYE JP baddies in the 2nd row
"I love the chaos of the playoffs, but my bracket man, it‚Äôs all screwed up üòÇ"
Mine would&#39;ve been solid as hell if it weren&#39;t for jimmy
@BuzzinFromda4z Knicks got me with heat too
"I only got bucks and heat wrong , üò≠ I got lakers In 5"
Jason Williams said jrue holiday could guard mj üò≠üò≠ü•¥
He got punked by MJ. Also just bc Jimmy slaughtered him doesn&#39;t mean MJ could. Stop doing this and dissing greats that aren&#39;t MJ or LeBron. It&#39;s annoying AF
Herro isn&#39;t a rotation piece
That buccs series really blew me dawg I didn‚Äôt see that at all
Jimmy da goat
üò≠ maybe next season
"Playoffs been so good so far, just need the injuries to chill üòÖ"
Not really. It‚Äôs been average.
"Then guess what, little girls, stop watching üòÇü§¶ smh yall gonna sit here and complain when injuries have existed forever shut up.<br><br>These playoffs have been exciting, competitive, and the championship is more open than ever."
@jrdb19kinda. bucks were and heat are down key players and celtics might beat everyone if 76ers bench is ass like every year. If the west hurt nuggets look like the favorite which means nuggets celtics and if we see brunson emerge as some superman and win a title the league dont got no answer for what the future entailsüòÇüòÇ
@techmen1222 ok does that take away from excitement of games no and really besides kawhi no injury has impacted the series to much giannas came back and the heat were missing herro and oldipo ja came back and played well knicks handles cleavland without randle the Celtics and hawks was healthy philly and Brooklyn and golden state and the kings no injuries amazing series yea u tripping
"wdym its been trash asf, literally half the league injured"
LFGGGG BRON V CURRY! LAST DANCE! This upcoming series literally defined a whole decade of our life between these two special players.
844wy7
@Apollo Calrissian same can be said if he loses
"@Scott Dick LeBron&#39;s averaging 22, and shooting 19% from three, and 67% from the line... winning a 5th ring on a team where he isn&#39;t even the best player on the squad and still being a ring behind MJ who won all 6 as the best player IN THE WORLD would not effect the Goat debate in the slightest"
‚Äã@TooGoat Nah AD is still not even the guy that you would rely on in matching him against Looney or the Warriors. He&#39;s prominent when he doesn&#39;t play soft
@Mathew Colato Stop it. Cope harder.
Heat culture baby üî•üî•üî•
First one here
"much love man, watching from Serbia"
Celtics in 4
Warriors n 6
The best playoff ever!! Don‚Äôt care about injuries!! This makes it more balanced!!
@Wtf foreal hope it ain&#39;t bad
I never thought I‚Äôd see somebody say playoff injuries make it more balanced. I could see if we were still in the superstar era lol
Well if Butler is out with ankle is not really balanced
What a game
