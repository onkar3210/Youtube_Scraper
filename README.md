# YouTube Data Scraper

Welcome to the YouTube Data Scraper â€“ a portfolio project showcasing my exploration into the realm of data analysis using Python. This project is a testament to my interest and proficiency in leveraging data for meaningful insights. As a self-driven individual, I've designed this application to demonstrate my skills in data scraping and analysis, specifically focusing on YouTube data.


## Features

- **YouTube API Integration**: Utilizes the YouTube API to scrape data, including comments, video details, and channel details.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Implemented with Flask, the project offers a simple web interface where users can select the type of data they want to analyze.
- **Data Options**: Users can choose to retrieve comments, video statistics, or channel statistics based on their preference.
- **Dynamic Input**: The application prompts users to input a YouTube link corresponding to their selected data type.
- **Export to CSV**: A convenient option allows users to save the scraped data as CSV files for further analysis.
