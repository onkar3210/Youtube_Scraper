# YouTube Data Scraper

Welcome to the YouTube Data Scraper â€“ a portfolio project showcasing my exploration into the realm of data analysis using Python. This project is a testament to my interest and proficiency in leveraging data for meaningful insights. As a self-driven individual, I've designed this application to demonstrate my skills in data scraping and analysis, specifically focusing on YouTube data.


## Features

- **YouTube API Integration**: Utilizes the YouTube API to scrape data, including comments, video details, and channel details.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Implemented with Flask, the project offers a simple web interface where users can select the type of data they want to analyze.
- **Data Options**: Users can choose to retrieve comments, video statistics, or channel statistics based on their preference.
- **Dynamic Input**: The application prompts users to input a YouTube link corresponding to their selected data type.
- **Export to CSV**: A convenient option allows users to save the scraped data as CSV files for further analysis.

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Flask
- YouTube API Key (Get one [here](https://console.developers.google.com/))

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/onkar3210/Youtube_Scraper.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your YouTube API key:**

    - Obtain a YouTube API key by following the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).
    - Add your API key to the `config.py` file.

4. **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    $ python app.py
    ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

 **Run the Flask Application:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   $ python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
